## Scaled dot product attention

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/scaled_attention.png" width="500" alt="scaled_dot_product_attention">

The attention function used by the transformer takes three inputs: Q (query), K (key), V (value). The equation used to calculate the attention weights is:

$$\Large{Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax_k(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}) V} $$

The dot-product attention is scaled by a factor of square root of the depth. This is done because for large values of depth, the dot product grows large in magnitude pushing the softmax function where it has small gradients resulting in a very hard softmax.

For example, consider that `Q` and `K` have a mean of 0 and variance of 1. Their matrix multiplication will have a mean of 0 and variance of `dk`. Hence, *square root of `dk`* is used for scaling (and not any other number) because the matmul of `Q` and `K` should have a mean of 0 and variance of 1, so that we get a gentler softmax.

The mask is multiplied with -1e9 (close to negative infinity). This is done because the mask is summed with the scaled matrix multiplication of Q and K and is applied immediately before a softmax. The goal is to zero out these cells, and large negative inputs to softmax are near zero in the output.


def scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, mask):
  """Calculate the attention weights.

  but it must be broadcastable for addition.

  Args:
    q: query shape == (..., seq_len_q, depth)
    k: key shape == (..., seq_len_k, depth)
    v: value shape == (..., seq_len_v, depth_v)

  matmul_qk = tf.matmul(q, k, transpose_b=True)  # (..., seq_len_q, seq_len_k)

  # scale matmul_qk
  dk = tf.cast(tf.shape(k)[-1], tf.float32)
  scaled_attention_logits = matmul_qk / tf.math.sqrt(dk)

  # add the mask to the scaled tensor.
  if mask is not None:
    scaled_attention_logits += (mask * -1e9)

  # softmax is normalized on the last axis (seq_len_k) so that the scores
  # add up to 1.
  attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(scaled_attention_logits, axis=-1)  # (..., seq_len_q, seq_len_k)

  output = tf.matmul(attention_weights, v)  # (..., seq_len_q, depth_v)

  return output, attention_weights


As the softmax normalization is done on K, its values decide the amount of importance given to Q.

The output represents the multiplication of the attention weights and the V (value) vector. This ensures that the words we want to focus on are kept as is and the irrelevant words are flushed out.

temp_q = tf.constant([[10, 10, 0]], dtype=tf.float32)  # (1, 3)
print_out(temp_q, temp_k, temp_v)

Pass all the queries together.

## Multi-head attention

<img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/multi_head_attention.png" width="500" alt="multi-head attention">


Multi-head attention consists of four parts:
*    Linear layers and split into heads.
*    Scaled dot-product attention.
*    Concatenation of heads.
*    Final linear layer.

Each multi-head attention block gets three inputs; Q (query), K (key), V (value). These are put through linear (Dense) layers and split up into multiple heads.

The `scaled_dot_product_attention` defined above is applied to each head (broadcasted for efficiency). An appropriate mask must be used in the attention step.  The attention output for each head is then concatenated (using `tf.transpose`, and `tf.reshape`) and put through a final `Dense` layer.

Instead of one single attention head, Q, K, and V are split into multiple heads because it allows the model to jointly attend to information at different positions from different representational spaces. After the split each head has a reduced dimensionality, so the total computation cost is the same as a single head attention with full dimensionality.


class MultiHeadAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
    super(MultiHeadAttention, self).__init__()
    self.num_heads = num_heads
    self.d_model = d_model

    assert d_model % self.num_heads == 0

    self.depth = d_model // self.num_heads

    self.wq = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)
    self.wk = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)
    self.wv = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)

    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)

  def split_heads(self, x, batch_size):
    """Split the last dimension into (num_heads, depth).
    Transpose the result such that the shape is (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, depth)
    """
    x = tf.reshape(x, (batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.depth))
    return tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

  def call(self, v, k, q, mask):
    batch_size = tf.shape(q)[0]

    q = self.wq(q)  # (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
    k = self.wk(k)  # (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
    v = self.wv(v)  # (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)

    q = self.split_heads(q, batch_size)  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len_q, depth)
    k = self.split_heads(k, batch_size)  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len_k, depth)
    v = self.split_heads(v, batch_size)  # (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len_v, depth)

    # scaled_attention.shape == (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len_q, depth)
    # attention_weights.shape == (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len_q, seq_len_k)
    scaled_attention, attention_weights = scaled_dot_product_attention(
        q, k, v, mask)

    scaled_attention = tf.transpose(scaled_attention, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])  # (batch_size, seq_len_q, num_heads, depth)

    concat_attention = tf.reshape(scaled_attention,
                                  (batch_size, -1, self.d_model))  # (batch_size, seq_len_q, d_model)

    output = self.dense(concat_attention)  # (batch_size, seq_len_q, d_model)

    return output, attention_weights


    Create a `MultiHeadAttention` layer to try out. At each location in the sequence, `y`, the `MultiHeadAttention` runs all 8 attention heads across all other locations in the sequence, returning a new vector of the same length at each location.


The transformer model follows the same general pattern as a standard [sequence to sequence with attention model](nmt_with_attention.ipynb).

* The input sentence is passed through `N` encoder layers that generates an output for each word/token in the sequence.
* The decoder attends on the encoder's output and its own input (self-attention) to predict the next word.
